Disclosure of Corporate Governance Arrangements

The Listing Manual requires listed companies to describe in their company's Annual Reports their corporate governance practices with specific reference to the principles of the Code, as well as disclose and explain any deviation from any guideline of the Code. Companies should make a positive confirmation at the start of the corporate governance section of the company's Annual Report that they have adhered to the principles and guidelines of the Code, or specify each area of non-compliance. Many of these guidelines are recommendations for companies to disclose their corporate governance arrangements. For ease of reference, the specific principles and guidelines in the Code with express disclosure requirements are set out below:

•   Delegation of authority, by the Board to any board committee, to make decisions on certain board matters	Guideline 1.3

•   The Board should identify in the company's Annual Report each director it considers to be independent. Where the Board considers a director to be independent in spite of the existence of a relationship as stated in the Code that would otherwise deem a director not to be independent, the nature of the director's relationship and the reasons for considering him as independent should be disclosed	Guideline 2.3
