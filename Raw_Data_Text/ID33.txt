Q. No. Field Name Instruction/Guidance
1. Details of total energy
consumption and
energy intensity
1. The entity shall report the total electricity consumed,
fuel consumed and energy consumed from other
sources during the reporting period, as applicable.
Entities may also specify the other sources, in case
the same are significant.
2. Energy can be purchased from sources external to
the organization or produced by the organization
itself (self-generated). If the organization generates
electricity from a non-renewable or renewable fuel
source and then consumes the generated electricity,
the energy consumption shall be counted only once.
3. The above data shall be reported in terms of Joules
or multiples such as Giga Joules. Entities should
consistently apply conversion factors, for converting
fuel consumption into Joules, for the data disclosed.
In case, different standards and methodologies are
used, the same should be disclosed. Entities should
also disclose any contextual information necessary
to understand how the data has been compiled, such
as any standards, methodologies, assumptions
and/or calculation tools used.
4. Energy intensity per rupee of turnover shall be
calculated as the total energy consumed divided by
the total turnover in rupees.
5. Apart from turnover, entities may on a voluntary
basis, provide energy intensity ratio, based on other
metrics, such as:
• units of product;
• production volume (such as metric tons,
litres, or MWh);
• size (such as m2 floor space);
• number of full-time employees
2. PAT scheme of the
Government of India
Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme (“Scheme”)
has been launched by Bureau of Energy Efficiency under
the National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency
(NMEEE) [details available at the following link:

and water intensity
ratio
1. The entity shall report the total water withdrawn for
any use, along-with a break-up of its source into the
following:
 Surface water- refers to water that occurs
naturally on the Earth’s surface in ice sheets, ice
caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes,
rivers, and streams
 Ground water – refers to water that is being held
in, and that can be recovered from, an
underground formation
 Third party water – refers to municipal water and
other private suppliers of water
 Sea-water / desalinated water – refers to water in
a sea or ocean
 Other sources - Entities may specify the other
sources, in case the same are significant.
2. The entity shall report the total water consumption.
Total water consumption is a measure of water used
by an organization, that it is no longer available for
use by the ecosystem or local community, such as
water that has been withdrawn and incorporated
into products or has evaporated or is polluted to the
point of being unusable by other users, and is
therefore not released back to surface water,
groundwater, seawater, or a third party. It also
includes water that has been stored during the
reporting period for use or discharge in a
subsequent reporting period.
If the entity cannot directly measure its water
consumption, it may calculate this using the
following formula:
Total water consumption = Total water withdrawal –
total water discharge.
3. Water intensity per rupee of turnover shall be
calculated as the total water consumed divided by
the total turnover in rupees.
4. Apart from turnover, entities may on a voluntary
basis, provide water intensity ratio, based on other
metrics, such as:
• units of product;
• production volume (such as metric tons,
litres, or MWh);
• size (such as m2 floor space);
• number of full-time employees

5. Entities should also disclose any contextual
information necessary to understand how the data
has been compiled, such as any standards,

fulfill a purpose in place of new products,
components, or materials that would otherwise have
been used for that purpose. Preparation for re-use
and recycling are examples of recovery operations.

controlled burning of waste at high temperatures
 Waste that is sent to a landfill - landfilling refers to
depositing of waste in sanitary landfills, and excludes
uncontrolled waste disposal such as open burning
and dumping
 Other disposal operations: Entities may specify the
other disposal operations used, in case the same are
significant.
4. Entities should disclose any contextual information
necessary to understand the data, such as any

from renewable and
non-renewable
sources
1. Under this field, the entity shall provide a break-up
of electricity, fuel and other energy consumption
(Refer: P6, Essential Question 1), from renewable and
non-renewable sources.
2. Non-renewable energy sources are those that
cannot be replenished, reproduced, grown or
generated in a short time period through ecological
cycles or agricultural processes. These include fuel
distilled from petroleum or crude oil, such as
gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil; natural
gas, such as compressed natural gas (CNG), and
liquefied natural gas (LNG); fuels extracted from
natural gas processing and petroleum refining, such
as butane, propane, and liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG); coal; and nuclear power.
3. Renewable energy sources are those that can be

or agricultural processes. Renewable energy sources
can include geothermal, wind, solar, hydro, and
biomass.
2. Details of water
discharged
1. The entity shall report the total water discharged i.e.
the total effluents, water released (unused or after
use) for which the organization has no further use,
along-with a break-up by destination (to surface
water, groundwater, seawater, sent to third parties
or others – refer the guidance at Question 3 of
Essential indicators under P6) and by level of
treatment.
2. The organization can break down its water discharge
by the following treatment levels:
 Primary treatment, which aims to remove solid
substances that settle or float on the water
surface;
 Secondary treatment, which aims to remove
substances and materials that have remained in
the water, or are dissolved or suspended in it;
 Tertiary treatment, which aims to upgrade water
to a higher level of quality before it is discharged.
It includes processes that remove, for example,
heavy metals, nitrogen, and phosphorus.
In case an organization withdraws and discharges
water of good quality that does not require
treatment, the same can be explained.
3. Entities should also disclose any contextual
information necessary to understand how the data
