Pillar 2 – Planet
We have selected these metrics and disclosures
from existing frameworks and standards wherever
possible, through multiple consultations with
professionals working in this field and by assessing
which metrics exhibit the best combination of
universality (across industries and firms) and
materiality to long-term value creation.
The “core” set reflects metrics and disclosures
that relate corporate activities to the most material
and pressing environmental issues for society as
a whole – climate change, nature loss and the
availability of clean, fresh water. Of these, climate
change is perhaps the most universally material
theme and is certainly the most advanced from the
perspective of current corporate reporting. Nature
loss will be particularly relevant for companies with
facilities in or near sensitive ecological areas, as
well as those with significant agricultural operations,
supply chains or customers. Freshwater availability
will be most material for companies with significant
operations, supply chains or markets in waterstressed areas, particularly in developing countries.
The “expanded” set includes three additional
common themes – air pollution, water pollution
and solid waste – along with a recommendation
to report relevant metrics of resource circularity
to assess progress towards a circular economy
business model. Coverage of all seven themes
with individual quantitative metrics is far from
comprehensive. For example, additional air
pollutants will be material for some companies,
there are many more potentially material waste
streams, and there are hundreds of individual
water pollutants. Only the most commonly material
individual metrics are specified in each case, on
the assumption that companies will make such
additional disclosures as are particularly relevant to
their sector and business model.
Further potential impact areas, such as light and
noise pollution, radiation and visual disturbance,
are left out on the basis that they are likely to be
material only in a minority of cases.
In the planet pillar, assessing the materiality of
impacts on society associated with a given metric
can be a helpful basis for establishing its materiality
to long-term value creation for the company. This
is because a range of factors, including changes
in policy and regulation, and changes in employee,
consumer and investor expectations, are leading to
a convergence between societal value and financial
value. For the core and expanded metrics identified
below, a “disclose or explain” approach should be
followed on this basis.
Summary of key changes
Climate change
The language around alignment with the Task Force
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
was simplified to make clear that we advocate full
implementation of the TCFD recommendations,
including disclosure in main annual filings in the
shortest possible time frame. Language around
Scope 3 reporting was also aligned with the
language in the TCFD guidance. Language around
emissions reduction targets was adjusted to
accommodate targets that meet the goals of the
Paris Agreement on climate change but do not
specifically follow methodologies provided by the
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), given that
approved sectoral SBTi methodologies don’t yet
exist for all sectors.
The revised language also allows for cases where
companies with operations predominantly in
least-developed countries wish to align with the
Paris Agreement as it applies to those countries
(based on Nationally Determined Contributions).
For the avoidance of doubt, we nonetheless
recommend that all businesses commit to
achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions by 2050 or sooner, and to pursue
interim targets based on science.
Nature loss
The recommended core metrics relating to the
extent of and year-on-year change in land use in the
consultation draft were clarified and moved to the
expanded section, on the basis that they are not
currently widely reported and will take some time
to report on. An additional disclosure was added
to the expanded metrics to enable companies to
indicate the “quality” of land use.
The global nature crisis is, however, widely
considered to be of sufficient importance to
society and relevance to business that it should be
included among the core themes. A simpler metric
addressing another important aspect of pressure
on nature was therefore selected after extensive
consultation.
Freshwater availability
The definition of water stress was clarified and the
metric language was aligned more precisely with an
existing disclosure standard.
Air pollution
Reference to sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides
(NOx) was added, owing to their material contribution
to the adverse impacts of local air pollution.
Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism: Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation 55
Water pollution
Language and applicability were clarified and
reference to potassium was added.
Solid waste
Language and applicability were clarified alongside
acknowledgement that approaches for measuring
and disclosing on single-use plastics are still emerging
and that companies can make a positive contribution
to understanding of the issues by experimenting with
measurement and sharing their approach and results.
Resource availability
Language was broadened to allow for a range
of potential circularity metrics, acknowledging
that metrics are not yet standardized and further
experimentation and refinement from leading
companies is an urgent priority.
Valued impact metrics
Language and sources were clarified.

Climate change Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
For all relevant greenhouse gases (e.g. carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, F-gases etc.), report in metric tonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) GHG Protocol Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions.
Estimate and report material upstream and downstream (GHG
Protocol Scope 3) emissions where appropriate.
GRI 305:1-3,
TCFD,
GHG Protocol
Rationale
GHG emissions are the primary driver of rising global temperatures and therefore a key focus for policy,
regulatory, market and technology responses to limit climate change. As a result, business models
associated with significant emissions are likely to be more impacted by risks in the transition to a lowcarbon economy. While challenges remain in the accurate quantification of Scope 3 emissions, companies
across all major sectors of the economy already report on Scope 3 emissions and, in the context of the
transition to a low-carbon economy, material Scope 3 emissions may have a significant bearing on a
company’s potential for long-term value creation.
Climate change TCFD implementation
Fully implement the recommendations of the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). If necessary,
disclose a timeline of at most three years for full implementation.
Disclose whether you have set, or have committed to set, GHG
emissions targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris
Agreement – to limit global warming to well below 2°C above
pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C
– and to achieve net-zero emissions before 2050.

Rationale
The TCFD recommendations are already established as the primary framework for disclosure of
information on the management of climate-related risks and opportunities in main annual filings. Elevating
disclosure of metrics relating to people, planet, prosperity and principles of governance into main annual
filings is a key objective of this initiative and we therefore lend our full support to broader adoption of the
TCFD recommendations. Additionally, we emphasise the importance of GHG emissions targets that are in
line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Additional commentary
The Financial Stability Board established the TCFD because of concerns that companies were not
adequately measuring or reporting the financial implications of climate change. TCFD recommends that
listed companies disclose these financial impacts as part of their annual financial filings, aligned to the
legislative thresholds of financial disclosure.
The TCFD has developed recommendations on climate change disclosure in an annually updated,
publicly available report which is applicable for all sectors. The recommendations cover climate strategy,
governance, risk management and metrics and targets. As part of their risk management, companies
must identify and measure the financial implications of their material risks and opportunities under at least
two widely recognized climate scenarios.
The TCFD also provides a structure to help organizations develop a climate strategy and governance
arrangements to mitigate risk and take action on opportunities. The TCFD framework has achieved
significant uptake since launch and regulatory momentum is building globally; for example, more than
1,000 global organizations have declared their support for TCFD,38 the UK Prudential Regulation Authority
(PRA) has set out expectations for banks and insurers to report on climate risk, and reporting is now
mandatory for signatories to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment network (UNPRI)
(responsible for assets of $103 trillion). Financial institutions responsible for assets worth over $139 trillion
have already announced their support for TCFD.
The framework provides flexibility for setting metrics and targets but recommends that an emissions target
is set using the risk analysis under the business’s relevant climate scenarios. This supports companies
setting meaningful science-based targets in line with achieving net zero.
The Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)
have produced a joint TCFD Implementation Guide39 and related set of Good Practices40 for the reporting
of climate-related performance and risk in mainstream corporate reports in line with the TCFD framework.
And in 2019, the World Economic Forum issued a set of climate governance principles for boards of
directors. Developed in collaboration with PwC, these principles are designed to help increase directors’
climate awareness, embed climate issues into board structures and processes, and improve navigation of
the risks and opportunities that climate change poses to business.41
Nature loss Land use and ecological sensitivity
Report the number and area (in hectares) of sites owned,
leased or managed in or adjacent to protected areas and/or key
biodiversity areas (KBA).
GRI 304-1
Rationale
KBAs provide a science-based and internationally recognized means of identifying sites contributing
significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, while protected areas indicate nationally (and
often internationally) recognized areas of ecological or cultural importance, typically with specific legal
protections. Having operations inside or close to such areas indicates heightened risk of adverse impacts
on biodiversity and heightened risk of exposure to associated legal or reputational risk.
Additional commentary
This metric will only be applicable to a subset of companies with operations in or adjacent to protected
areas or KBAs, but for these companies it is an important indicator of heightened risk of adverse impacts
on biodiversity and heightened risk of exposure to associated legal or reputational risk. Alongside this
disclosure, companies may wish to share information on the measures in place to ensure effective
stewardship of these sites.

Rationale
Water consumption and water withdrawal in water-stressed areas are indicators of the potential for

risks including the potential for operational disruptions and shutdowns.
Additional commentary
This metric is only likely to be considered material to long-term value creation by a subset of companies
with significant water consumption and withdrawal in water-stressed areas. Alongside this disclosure, such
companies may wish to disclose the year-on-year change in each figure as well as additional information
on their water stewardship approach.

Climate change Paris-aligned GHG emissions targets
Define and report progress against time-bound science-based
GHG emissions targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris
Agreement – to limit global warming to well below 2°C above
pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.
This should include defining a date before 2050 by which you
will achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and interim
reduction targets based on the methodologies provided by the
Science Based Targets initiative, if applicable.
If an alternative approach is taken, disclose the methodology
used to calculate the targets and the basis on which they deliver
on the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Science Based
Targets initiative
Rationale
The Paris Agreement on climate change sets a long-term goal to keep the increase in global average
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to
1.5°C, recognizing that this would substantially reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. All actors,
including businesses, need to play their part in delivering on this goal if we are to avoid the worst effects of
climate change. In June 2020, countries representing more than half of global GDP set or committed to set
net-zero-by-2050 targets and more than 900 companies have published science-based targets consistent
with the Paris Agreement. As such, defining emissions targets that are at least consistent with meeting the
goal of the Paris Agreement is fast becoming the minimum expectation for businesses.

Nature loss Land use and ecological sensitivity
Report for operations (if applicable) and full supply chain
(if material):
1. Area of land used for the production of basic plant, animal or
mineral commodities (e.g. the area of land used for forestry,
agriculture or mining activities).
2. Year-on-year change in the area of land used for the
production of basic plant, animal or mineral commodities.
Note: Supply-chain figures can initially be estimated where
necessary based on the mass of each commodity used
and the average mass produced per unit of land in different
sourcing locations.
3. Percentage of land area in point 1 above or of total
plant, animal and mineral commodity inputs by mass or
cost, covered by a sustainability certification standard or
formalized sustainable management programme. Disclose
the certification standards or description of sustainable
management programmes along with the percentage of
total land area, mass or cost covered by each certification
standard/programme.
New metric
Rationale
Growth in demand for land is the primary underlying driver of new conversions of ecosystems, which is
in turn the primary driver of nature loss. The overall area of land used in operations and supply chains
reflects the contribution of the current business model to overall demand for land; and the year-on-year
change indicates whether the company is currently contributing to increasing or decreasing pressure for
new conversions of ecosystems. The proportion covered by a sustainability certification standard or other
formalized sustainable management programme is an indicator of how much of the land used is being
actively managed for long-term value creation.
Additional commentary
In addition to companies with significant agricultural, forestry or mining operations, this metric is likely to
be material to long-term value creation for any companies that rely on a significant volume of inputs from
agricultural or forestry systems. Sustainability certification standards or formalized sustainable management
programmes are the primary ways to ensure that any land which must be used for production is used in a
way that maintains or improves its quality and minimizes any adverse production impacts.

Rationale
Localized air pollution, in the form of fine particulate matter and oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, is a leading

particularly harmful because they contribute to high ambient concentrations of pollution and affect a large
number of people.

Water pollution Nutrients
Estimate and report wherever material along the value
chain: metric tonnes of nitrogen, phosphorous and
potassium in fertilizer consumed.
SASB CN0101-
11
Rationale
Keeping nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium cycles in balance is critical to the effective functioning of
ecosystems. Current agricultural practices have pushed bio-available levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium far beyond sustainable thresholds in many parts of the world, leading to freshwater and oceanic
dead zones and a host of other ecological and public health issues. “Biogeochemical flows” (of nitrogen
and phosphorous) is one of only two of the nine planetary boundaries42 that is already deemed to have
been breached. As such, all organizations with significant agricultural operations or supply chains are
recommended to identify their exposure to this global problem.
Additional commentary
In addition to companies with significant agricultural or forestry operations, this metric is likely to be material
to long-term value creation for any companies that rely on a significant volume of inputs from agricultural or
forestry systems. Proactive measures to avoid excess nutrients entering the environment are a key aspect
of good ecological stewardship and should form part of agreements with agricultural or forestry suppliers.
Alongside this disclosure, companies may wish to disclose the year-on-year change in each figure as
well as additional information on measures to avoid excess nutrients entering the wider environment, and
evidence of their effectiveness.

engagement with the risks and opportunities presented by the circular transition and can be used to
demonstrate progress towards genuine resource sustainability.
Additional commentary
Example organization-level circularity metrics include the Circular Transition Indicators developed by the
WBCSD43 including percentage of circular inflow and percentage of circular outflow of resources.
Circular inflow can be calculated as follows:
(weight of renewable inflow + weight of non-virgin inflow / total weight of all inflow) x 100%
Circular outflow is calculated as follows, per material flow:
((% recovery potential x % actual recovery) x weight) / total weight of all outflow
