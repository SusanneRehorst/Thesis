must contain the following information.
Asset values
2.—(1) If, in the case of such of the fixed assets of the company as consist in interests in land, their
market value (as at the end of the financial year) differs substantially from the amount at which they
are included in the balance sheet, and the difference is, in the directors’ opinion, of such significance
as to require that the attention of members of the company or of holders of its debentures should be
drawn to it, the report must indicate the difference with such degree of precision as is practicable.
(2) In relation to a group directors’ report sub-paragraph (1) has effect as if the reference to the
fixed assets of the company was a reference to the fixed assets of the company and of its subsidiary
undertakings included in the consolidation.

made any donations or incurred any such expenditure as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)

Kingdom,
the directors’ report for the year is not, by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), required to contain the
particulars specified in sub-paragraph (2).
But, if the total amount of any such donations or expenditure (or both) made or incurred in that year
by the company and the subsidiaries between them exceeds £2000, the directors’ report for the year
