Introduction
In 2019, the UK became the first major
economy to commit in law to net zero
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In 2021,
the government went further, setting in law
the world’s most ambitious climate change
target to cut emissions by 78% by 2035
compared to 1990 levels. To achieve this,
the whole economy will have to transform.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) is clear that immediate, rapid,
and large-scale reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions are needed. This transition
cannot be achieved without a significant shift
of investment into sustainable projects and
green technology. The financial system is
therefore critical to achieving net zero and
protecting the UK’s natural environment.
This shift is well underway. The market for
Environment, Social and Governance (ESG)
investments in the UK has grown dramatically.
Businesses and financial institutions are
responding to the challenge and impetus
to grow in responsible, sustainable ways.
The demand for sustainable products is
high: 70% of the UK public want their money
to go towards making a positive difference
to people or planet.1
 And the market is
responding: data from the Investment
Association finds that 49% of the £9.4 trillion
in UK assets were integrating ESG in their
investment processes in 2020, up from 37% in
2019 (see Figure D).2
Box 1: What is sustainability?
Responding to widespread investor and consumer demand, organisations are increasingly
reporting sustainability information. Whilst there is no single definition of ‘sustainability’,
voluntary reporting is often framed around three key factors – Environment, Social
and Governance:
Environment: This covers how organisations impact and are impacted by climate change
and broader environmental issues, like biodiversity. Reporting on climate change is rapidly
becoming mainstream. Global reporting standards are emerging that are underpinned by
international agreements on underlying climate policy. Beyond climate, the data needed to
drive wider environmental objectives is less developed – although this is changing through
initiatives like the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).
Social: This includes factors ranging from modern slavery to international development.
Investors have long considered these matters in their investment decisions and many
engage actively with investee companies on these topics. Globally agreed reporting
standards may take longer to emerge, but there are existing frameworks which may provide
a basis for future global standard setting.
Governance: Covers the means by which a company is controlled and directed, most usually
through a Board of Directors. It is the longest established area for investor engagement and
extensive disclosure is already provided by companies through existing company law and
other requirements.

In 2019, the government published the
Green Finance Strategy. This was a landmark
document setting out a suite of ambitious
policy commitments to help align UK financial
flows with a low-carbon world. It highlighted
two key lines of effort. The first was
‘greening finance’: supporting the financial
services sector to align with the UK’s net
zero commitment and wider environmental
goals. The second was ‘financing green’:
mobilising private finance at scale to support
clean and resilient growth. It also committed
to capturing the opportunities presented
by the transition to net zero, cementing UK
leadership in green finance and ensuring that
businesses can benefit.
Box 2: Delivering on the Green Finance Strategy
✓ Committed to making TCFD-aligned disclosures mandatory across the economy
✓ Included an obligation in their remit letters for the financial regulators to have
regard to climate
✓ Led G7 discussions on the development of global standards for sustainability disclosure
✓ Committed to implementing a UK Green Taxonomy to provide a shared understanding of
which economic activities count as green
✓ Issued a Green Gilt, representing the largest debut transaction size for any sovereign at
£10bn and kick-starting a green financing programme
✓ Working to catalyse market-led action on nature-related financial disclosures
Over the last two years, the government has
delivered on the commitments set out in the
Green Finance Strategy (see Box 2). Now the
government is building on these successfully
laid foundations and raising our earlier
ambitions. Greening the financial system can
be seen in three phases:
 Phase 1: Informing investors and
consumers – addressing the information
gap for market participants, ensuring
a flow of decision-useful information
on environmental sustainability
from corporates to financial
market participants.
 Phase 2: Acting on the information –
creating expectations and requirements
that this sustainability information
is mainstreamed into business and
financial decisions, for example in risk
management and investor stewardship.
 Phase 3: Shifting financial flows –
ensuring that financial flows across
the economy shift to align with the
UK’s net zero commitment and wider
environmental goals.
This Roadmap represents the government’s
strategy to deliver Phase 1. Central to this are
new economy-wide Sustainability Disclosure
Requirements. These will bring together
new and existing sustainability reporting
requirements for business, the financial
sector and investment products. This will
allow sustainability information to flow
from companies in the real economy to the
financial sector and its financial products. That
information will help empower investors and
consumers to make financial decisions which
align with their values (see Figure A).
7
Box 3: What is ‘greenwashing’?
‘Greenwashing’ is when misleading or unsubstantiated claims about environmental
performance are made by businesses or investment funds about their products or activities.
This can lead to the wrong products being bought – undermining trust in the market and
leading to misallocation of capital intended for sustainable investments.
Greenwashing was the most frequently cited concern amongst respondents to the 2021
Schroders Institutional Investor Study3, with 60% of ESG investors raising it as a challenge.
The FCA has received a growing number of low-quality authorisation applications from
ESG-themed funds, many of whose sustainability claims did not stand up to scrutiny.
The steps outlined in this Roadmap will help consumers better judge the sustainability
characteristics of products and firms, supporting the continued growth of the market for
sustainable finance.
This Roadmap will:
 Set out more details on the Sustainability
Disclosure Requirements to help
businesses prepare for what they will
have to report and by when (Chapter 1)
 Set out more detail on the UK Green
Taxonomy (Chapter 2)
 Highlight the importance of investor
stewardship in green finance
and set out the government’s
expectations (Chapter 3)
 Reiterate the UK's commitment to
international leadership on green finance
A comprehensive long-term view is also
needed. The government will therefore
update the Green Finance Strategy in
2022. This will go beyond the timescales
in this Roadmap and set out an indicative
sectoral transition pathway out to 2050 to
align the financial system with the UK’s net
zero commitment. The updated strategy
will assess industry progress on Phases
1 and 2. It will also consider triggers for
stronger policy to facilitate Phase 3 and help
ensure that the UK meets its climate and
environmental objectives.

Chapter 1: Getting the
right information to market
participants
9
Disclosure is the process by which
organisations provide information
to customers, investors, and other
stakeholders, for example through their
Annual Report. Sustainability information is
increasingly fundamental to investor decisionmaking and informs many businesses’
strategic direction.
Voluntary sustainability disclosures
are widespread but often inconsistent;
information from different organisations is
not always comparable. There is a clear
need for an effective government-led
sustainability disclosures regime which
enables the flow of comparable and decisionuseful information on how companies and
financial flows impact – and are impacted
by – climate, the environment and broader
sustainability factors.
Box 4: The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was created in 2015 by the
Financial Stability Board. It developed recommendations for companies to disclose how they
manage the financial risks and opportunities that climate change poses to their business.
The TCFD recommendations have received widespread acceptance and are applied by
companies around the world. In November 2020, the Chancellor announced that the UK
intends to make TCFD-aligned disclosures fully mandatory across the UK economy by
2025. Since then, the government and regulators have made significant progress towards
this ambition:
 In December 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) finalised its TCFD-aligned
disclosure rules for UK premium-listed companies.
 In March 2021, the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)
consulted on mandatory climate-related financial disclosure requirements for certain
publicly quoted companies, large private companies, and Limited Liability Partnerships.
The consultation closed in May.
 In June 2021, the FCA consulted on proposals to extend its TCFD requirements to
standard-listed issuers and to require UK-authorised asset managers, life insurers and
pension providers to publish client-focused TCFD-aligned disclosures.
 In July 2021, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) laid legislation before
Parliament requiring a variety of pension schemes to make certain TCFD disclosures and
effectively manage climate-related risks and opportunities.
Beyond TCFD, the UK has long been a world-leader on embedding sustainability into
corporate reporting. Since 2013, the government has required companies to include a
Strategic Report in their Annual Report to facilitate the reporting of non-financial information.
In 2016, the government added further reporting requirements for large Public Interest
Entities (PIEs) - over 500 employees - requiring them to disclose information on their
environmental impact, social matters, employees, human rights, and anti-bribery and
corruption. And since 2019, the government has required all large UK companies to disclose
their greenhouse gas emissions.
10
Sustainability Disclosure
Requirements
The Chancellor announced new Sustainability
Disclosure Requirements (SDR) at his
Mansion House speech in July 2021. SDR
will create an integrated framework for
decision-useful disclosures on sustainability
across the economy. It will, for the first time,
bring together existing sustainability-related
disclosure requirements under one integrated
framework – building on leading global
standards and best practice – and go further
with new requirements.
SDR builds on the UK’s TCFD implementation
and will cover three types of disclosure (see
Figure B and Annex A for further details):
1. Corporate disclosure: New requirements
for companies – including in the financial
services sector – to make sustainability
disclosures. This will, subject to
consultation, comprise reporting under
proposed international standards (see
Box 5) and reporting of environmental
impact using the UK Green Taxonomy
(see Chapter 2).
2. Asset manager and asset owner
disclosure: New requirements for asset
managers and asset owners that manage
or administer assets on behalf of clients
and consumers (including occupational
pension schemes) to disclose how they
take sustainability into account. These
will help consumers determine whether
their assets are managed according to
their sustainability preferences.
3. Investment product disclosure: New
requirements for creators of investment
products to report on the products’
sustainability impact and relevant
financial risks and opportunities. This
information will form the basis of a new
sustainable investment labelling regime
that will make it easier for consumers
to navigate the range of investment
products available to them (see Box 6).
SDR will use the same framework and metrics
across the economy to ensure a clear and
direct link from investors, through the financial
system to the businesses they are invested in
and their relationship with the environment.
Metrics will be drawn from international
standards, where they exist, to support
international compatibility.

Box 5: Towards a global baseline corporate reporting standard
for sustainability
For every investor globally to embed climate and sustainability into their decision making,
markets need consistent and accurate information. This can only be achieved through a
global standard which all companies report against.
The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation is the international body
that governs the setting of global accounting standards, adopted by the UK and over 140
other jurisdictions around the world. It is now establishing an International Sustainability
Standards Board (ISSB) to develop global baseline reporting standards for sustainability,
building on the work of the TCFD and other voluntary standard setters. The ISSB will provide
comprehensive and granular corporate reporting standards for sustainability, focused
on information which is material to investors. The government expects the Board to be
established later this year, and, in early 2022, for the Board to consult on a draft climaterelated standard, before expanding its standard-setting to broader environmental and
sustainability factors.
The UK is a strong supporter of the IFRS Foundation and is proud that the Foundation has
been based in London for the last twenty years. As an established international standardsetter with a transparent and robust governance structure, it is the right organisation to
develop international standards in this area. The government expects that ISSB standards
will form a core component of the SDR framework, and the backbone of its corporate
reporting element.
To deliver this, the government will create a mechanism to adopt and endorse ISSBissued standards for use in the UK. The proposed overarching framework will be subject to
consultation. Regulatory changes will ensure that UK reporting under the ISSB standards is
consistent with both existing and forthcoming disclosure requirements so that companies are
not required to report the same information twice.
12
A consistent structure
The TCFD recommendations set a framework
for climate-related financial disclosure based
on four pillars: Strategy, Governance, Risk
Management, and Metrics and Targets.
The government expects that the standards
developed by the ISSB will build on the four
pillars of the TCFD recommendations. SDR
will integrate these global standards and will
similarly adopt the four pillars of the TCFD
recommendations (see Figure B).
Beyond financial risks and
opportunities
The ISSB’s standards, building on the work
of the TCFD, will focus on information which
is material to investors. SDR will go further,
requiring wider information on how firms
impact the environment. This includes
requiring disclosure against the UK’s Green
Taxonomy (see Chapter 2).
A robust ESG market
The market for sustainable investments is
complex and evolving. Some ESG factors will
not be covered by the UK Green Taxonomy
or ISSB standards but may nevertheless be
the subject of firms’ claims to consumers.
The FCA has already set out its expectations
regarding design, delivery and disclosure of
ESG and sustainable investment funds. SDR
will go further in two areas:
 Substantiate sustainability claims:
Building on the FCA’s existing
expectations, asset managers/owners
and investment products will be required
to substantiate ESG claims they make
in a way that is comparable between
products and is accessible to clients
and consumers. They will also need to
disclose whether and how they take
ESG-related matters into account in their
governance arrangements, and in their
investment policies and strategies.
 Minimum safeguards: The UK’s
Green Taxonomy requires sustainable
investments to satisfy minimum
safeguards relating to basic good
business practice. The SDR will require
disclosure against these minimum
safeguards and any related metrics
(see Chapter 2).
Over time, the ISSB standards will expand
beyond climate to cover broader sustainability
issues. In the meantime, the government
and regulators encourage disclosure against
established voluntary standards.
Box 6: Sustainable investment
labelling regime
The FCA is working closely with HM
Treasury on the development of a
sustainable investment labelling regime.
The labels will help consumers select
investment products based on their
sustainability characteristics and will
be supported by the underlying SDR
disclosures. It is envisaged that the
labelling regime will cover the spectrum
of investment products, classifying them
objectively against specified sustainability
criteria, and considering a) products’
objectives, policies, and strategies, and
b) how their investments are allocated.
The FCA intends to publish further detail
in an Autumn 2021 Discussion Paper
and will set up an advisory forum to help
inform the work.

Figure B: The framework of the UK Sustainability Disclosure
Requirements (SDR)
SDR is based on an economy-wide framework covering corporates, asset managers, asset
owners, and investment products. Figure B outlines what firms will be required to disclose. The
government intends to implement the framework through legislation, and relevant government
departments and regulators will set out sector-specific requirements through their usual rulemaking processes.

Transition plans
An increasing number of organisations
are making commitments to reach net
zero emissions. Many organisations
publish transition plans to support these
commitments, setting out concrete actions
and targets to achieve their ambition. Against
the backdrop of its legislative commitment
to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,
the government would like to support and
encourage organisations in this process.
Detailed, credible transition plans that
are integrated with other disclosures and
incorporate interim milestones and targets,
can support markets in monitoring progress
towards a net-zero economy. They are also
essential for the effective exercise of market
discipline, and investors’ ability to hold
investee company boards and management to
account. The government therefore expects to
see the publication of transition plans become
the norm across the economy.
While there is not yet a commonly agreed
standard or ‘template’ for what a good quality
transition plan looks like, this is rapidly
changing. The TCFD has finalised guidance on
transition plans4, and groups such as Climate
Action 100+ and the Institutional Investors
Group on Climate Change have undertaken
relevant work. The Glasgow Financial Alliance
for Net Zero (GFANZ) is also working to
develop best practice guidance for financial
sector transition strategies that is applicable
across financial sub-sectors and jurisdictions.
SDR will require disclosures on transition
plans. Initially, certain firms will be required
to publish transition plans that align with
the government’s net zero commitment
or provide an explanation if they have not
done so. As standards for transition plans
emerge, the government and regulators will
look to incorporate these into UK regulation
and strengthen disclosure requirements as
appropriate. This will encourage consistency
and comparability in published plans and
support more widespread adoption.

Box 7: ESG Data
ESG data and ratings providers
As the market for sustainable financial products and services grows, firms and consumers
increasingly rely on providers of ESG-related services, including ratings, data, and
verification. This market is expected to continue to grow strongly over the next few years
and could reach the $1 billion mark by end of 2021 for ESG data alone, according to
research by Optimas.
ESG ratings are becoming increasingly important to the investment process. However,
different ESG ratings agencies provide opinions on different aspects of sustainability
performance and their assessments may not always be comparable. There are also typically
more data gaps and assumptions made in producing ESG ratings than, for example,
credit ratings.
It is important that providers deliver ESG data and ratings transparently, and that they have
strong governance and management of conflicts of interests. The government is therefore
considering bringing these firms into the scope of FCA authorisation and regulation. The
government will set out further detail next year.
Digitisation of reported information
As the importance of sustainability disclosures has increased, so has the demand for this
information to be easily read and analysed electronically. The International Organization
of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recently published a report on issuers’ sustainability
disclosures. In it, some asset managers called for enhanced digitisation and storage of
sustainability information to support machine readability.
The government and regulators are considering how to deliver an approach to digitisation
of sustainability data that builds on the UK’s existing digital infrastructure for reporting. This
includes assessing the value of a centralised register for ESG data.
Delivering Sustainability Disclosure
Requirements
The government’s aim is for SDR to be a
fully integrated regime that works smoothly
across all sectors of the economy. Within
that, relevant regulators and government
departments will determine the precise scope
and timing of requirements, and the reporting
detail, subject to relevant consultation
processes and other statutory requirements.
Figure C sets out an indicative path towards
integrated economy-wide disclosure
requirements under the SDR framework.
It illustrates how disclosures could be
introduced coherently and systematically as
new regulatory and legislative measures come
into force, subject to consultation processes
and other statutory requirements. Annex A
outlines sectoral pathways and summarises
the intended regulatory approach for each
type of organisation and product.
HM Treasury will co-ordinate the sectoral
approaches centrally to ensure that the
right information is made available across
the investment chain – from corporates, to
financial services firms, to end-investors.
Initial steps, like introducing TCFDaligned disclosure requirements, have
already been taken.
Given the indicative pathways, organisations
should consider taking the necessary steps
now to build their capabilities and refine their
data and the resulting disclosures.

Chapter 2: Defining what
counts as green
20
A large and growing number of financial
products are marketed as supporting climate
or environmental objectives. Similarly, an
increasing number of companies are eager to
highlight their sustainable business practices.
However, there is not an accepted definition
of which economic activities count as
environmental sustainability.
The lack of common definitions makes
it difficult for companies and investors
to clearly understand the environmental
impact of their decisions and can lead to
consumer harms like greenwashing. This risks
limiting the flow of capital into sustainable
investments and ultimately slowing the UK’s
progress to tackle climate change and other
environmental challenges.
To address this, the government is
implementing the UK Green Taxonomy ('the
Taxonomy'). This will clearly set out the criteria
which specific economic activities must meet
to be considered environmentally sustainable
and therefore 'Taxonomy-aligned'.

Aims
Reporting against the Taxonomy will form
part of SDR. Certain companies will be
required to disclose which proportion of their
activities are Taxonomy-aligned. Providers of
investment funds and products will have to do
the same for the assets that they invest in. The
Taxonomy aims to:
1. Create clarity and consistency for
investors: Investors will be able to easily
compare the environmental performance
and impact of companies and investment
funds to inform their financial decisions.
2. Improve understanding of
companies’ environmental impact:
Taxonomy disclosures will facilitate
an understanding of companies’
contribution to environmental
sustainability.
3. Provide a reference point for
companies: The Taxonomy will
provide companies with an informative
performance target. For example, they
can also, on a voluntary basis, use the
Taxonomy to develop and communicate
their net zero transition and capital
investment plans.
Approach
The structure of the Taxonomy draws on the
EU approach which the UK helped design as
a former Member State. The government’s
implementation process will be guided by
three core principles:
1. Robust and evidence-based: The
Taxonomy will take an objective and
science-based approach to assessing
sustainability. To support this, the
government has created a Green
Technical Advisory Group (see Box 8) to
provide advice on implementation.
2. Accessible: The government intends
both for the Taxonomy to be useful
to investors and for disclosure
requirements not to place a
disproportionate burden on business.
The government will take a co-ordinated
and consultative approach to developing
the Taxonomy, incorporating learning
from other taxonomies developed
internationally.
3. Built for the UK to support a global
transition: The government will take
an approach that is suitable for the
UK market and consistent with UK
government policy. There will also
be a clear focus on the benefits of
coherence and compatibility with other
international frameworks.

Each of the environmental objectives will be
underpinned by a set of detailed standards,
known as Technical Screening Criteria
(TSC). There will be an individual TSC for
each economic activity included in the
Taxonomy, which identifies how that activity
can make a substantial contribution to the
environmental objective.
To be considered Taxonomy-aligned, an
activity must meet three tests:
1. Make a substantial contribution to
one of six environmental objectives
(listed above): The criteria for making a
substantial contribution are set out in the
TSC for the activity in question.
2. Do no significant harm to the other
objectives: This is also defined for
each activity in the TSCs. This aims to
ensure that activities which support
one objective, such as climate change
mitigation, do not have a significant
adverse impact on another, such
as biodiversity.
3. Meet a set of minimum safeguards:
These are minimum standards for doing
business, constituting alignment with
the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises, and the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Taxonomy and transition
Taxonomy-alignment focuses on reported
data, rather than projections. This provides
a clear snapshot of the areas in which a
company is currently making a substantial
contribution to environmental objectives. In
the case of the climate change mitigation
objective, that is whether or not an activity
contributes to the reduction of greenhouse
gas emissions, consistent with the UK's net
zero commitment and commitments under the
Paris Agreement.
However, the Taxonomy also recognises
companies which are working to
meet environmental objectives in the
future in two ways:
1. Transitional activities: Due to
technological constraints, some
economic activities cannot currently be
conducted in a way which is aligned
with net zero-ambitions. For a number
of these activities, the TSCs will set the
threshold for Taxonomy alignment at the
best-in-sector emissions level (subject to
not locking in carbon-intensive activities).
The manufacture of cement is one
example of this.
2. Investment: Companies will report the
proportion of their capital expenditure
which is Taxonomy-aligned. This will
enable companies to demonstrate their
investment in producing green activities
in the future.
The Taxonomy will also include Enabling
Activities. This recognises activities which
currently support the transition by enabling
substantial contributions to environmental
objectives in other sectors, but which are not
yet sustainable themselves. This will include,
for example, the manufacture of components
for wind turbines.
Disclosure against the Taxonomy is not
a replacement for robust science-based
targets. The UK has set out standards for
UK Climate Transition Benchmarks, which
support investors in reducing the emissions
they fund over time.5 In future, providers of
financial products may choose to supplement
Taxonomy disclosures with Portfolio Alignment
Tools to estimate funds’ emissions trajectories.
Using the information
Under SDR (see Chapter 1), certain companies
will be required to disclose the percentage
of their capital expenditure, operational
expenditure and turnover that relates to
Taxonomy-aligned activities. These corporate
disclosures will provide investors and
consumers with an indicator of a company’s
current environmental performance, as well as
its investment in sustainable activities.
Informed by reliable data from corporate
disclosures, providers of investment products
will then disclose the extent to which those
products are Taxonomy-aligned, based on
their constituent assets.6 This will enable
investors to identify the investment products
which are making a substantial contribution to
environmental objectives.

the transition to a low-carbon economy (based on the scientific evidence of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). It does so through
the selection and weighting of underlying constituent assets. At least a 30% reduction in carbon versus the investable universe is required,
followed by a 7% year-on-year “decarbonisation trajectory” in order to qualify for the benchmark, which works as a sustainability label.
6 Companies that do not fall under the scope of SDR mandatory reporting requirements, but which do conduct activities included in the
taxonomy may voluntarily report their alignment.
Box 8: Green Technical Advisory
Group (GTAG)
In June 2021, the government launched
the Green Technical Advisory Group
(GTAG) to provide independent advice
on market, regulatory and scientific
considerations around developing and
implementing the Taxonomy. Chaired by
the Green Finance Institute, the GTAG first
met in June and has since established
a workplan and structure in line with its
Terms of Reference (see annex B). The
Terms of Reference and Membership
List are available on the government
website, and more information is
available on the Green Finance Institute’s
Taxonomy webpage.7,8
The development and
implementation process
The UK will implement TSCs for each of the
Taxonomy’s objectives, ensuring that these
are evidence-based, accessible and built for
the UK market. This means that:
 The government will ensure that TSC
development is clearly signposted to
business. Companies will have adequate
notice before becoming subject to
disclosure requirements.
 TSCs will be subject to public
consultation to ensure that they
take a rigorous approach that works
for the UK market.
 TSCs will be made through statutory
instruments.9 This ensures Parliamentary
scrutiny and should further reassure
stakeholders that the TSCs will not be
amended without due notice.
 The government will use regulatory
guidance and develop presentational
tools to increase ease of application.
This will be complemented by ongoing
policy work, including on adaptation.
 Disclosure requirements for corporates
will come into force prior to those
for investment products, enabling
the former to feed into the latter.
This is in line with the sequenced
approach of SDR.
 The government plans to focus on
delivering the Taxonomy and ensuring
that it has been road-tested by the
market before considering any changes
or an extension to its scope. This
includes identifying activities which
cause significant harm, or adding further
transitional activities.
Taken together, the above will ensure that the
Taxonomy is implemented and built to deliver
for the needs of UK business and investors
and is robust enough to support the UK’s netzero commitment.
Climate change mitigation and
climate change adaptation
TSCs for the climate change mitigation, and
climate change adaptation objectives will
be based on those of the EU Taxonomy,
which the UK supported the development of
whilst still a Member State. The Government
is currently reviewing these and expects to
consult on UK draft TSCs in the first quarter
of 2022, ahead of legislating by the end of
2022. These TSCs will focus on economic
activities which can make the most significant
contributions to tackling climate change.

Box 9: Approach to energy sector – the Energy Working Group
Reliable and affordable power and heat are an essential foundation of a modern economy
and crucial to the potential future electrification of a range of sectors such as transport and
industry as the UK transitions to net zero. It is therefore vital that the UK Green Taxonomy
assist investors in identifying energy-related activities that will support the net-zero transition.
When developing the Taxonomy’s energy criteria, the government’s approach will be
science-based, accessible and aligned with its net-zero policy.
The government has established an Energy Working Group (EWG), chaired by the Chief
Scientific Advisor to BEIS, to advise on the development of TSCs in the energy sector.
Members are independent of the government, with membership drawn from academia and
expert organisations. The EWG will advise on key energy system issues such as hydrogen,
carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and nuclear energy.
The government has asked the EWG to prioritise considering nuclear power’s role in the
UK Taxonomy. Nuclear power – as a low-carbon technology – represents a crucial element
of the government’s plans to reach net zero. It has a clear basis for making a ‘substantial
contribution’ to the Taxonomy’s objective of climate change mitigation. The EWG is
therefore considering evidence to support its inclusion in the Taxonomy, including the
requirement to ensure that its activities meet the wider eligibility criteria to ‘do no significant
harm’ to the other Taxonomy objectives. The EWG’s advice will inform the government’s
decisions regarding nuclear and the Taxonomy, and support TSC development ahead of a
public consultation.
Development of Further Technical
Screening Criteria
The government intends for the Taxonomy
to be a tool for the long term. To limit the
need for revision, the Taxonomy will focus on
the outcomes of economic activities, rather
than technologies used. The government
will review the Taxonomy Regulation’s
effectiveness every three years. This review
will also consider whether enabling or
transitional activities remain in line with the
relevant Taxonomy objectives.
Over time, the government may update
the TSCs or expand them to new sectors,
following the same process of consultation
and legislation. The government expects
to consult on the expansion of the climate
TSCs and standards for the remaining
four environmental objectives during the
first quarter of 2023 in advance of laying
legislation before Parliament.

Chapter 3: Being a responsible
steward of capital
29
Stewardship is the responsible allocation, management and oversight
“
of capital to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries leading to
sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society.
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) ‘The UK Stewardship Code 2020
”
What is investor stewardship and
why is it important?
By effectively engaging in stewardship
activities, investors can improve investment
returns by encouraging and supporting
behaviours and practices that ensure longterm value for clients and savers.10 Effective
stewardship by both asset owners and
asset managers is crucial to the successful
management of risks, opportunities
and impacts presented by climate and
environmental change. Stewardship can be a
powerful vehicle to hold companies to account
for the feasibility and credibility of their
net-zero commitments, and their transition
strategies to align their business models with
a net-zero economy. Investors also decide
how capital is allocated, for example to
companies and technologies that contribute to
these ambitions.
The UK’s pensions and investment sectors –
namely asset owners, asset managers, and
the service providers that support them –
have an important role to play in responsibly
allocating capital and making use of their
ownership rights and influence over investee
companies, whilst fulfilling their fiduciary
responsibilities. The government expects the
pensions and investment sectors to use the
information generated by SDR to deliver on
their responsibilities as stewards of capital
across all asset classes and markets. For
example, engaging with investee companies
in high-carbon sectors, and working with them
to successfully transition to net zero, will help
protect investments against the systemic risks
of climate change.
In practice, this means that – as the owners
and primary allocators of capital – the
pensions and investment sectors should seek
to integrate ESG considerations into:
 Investment decision-making: When
deciding where to allocate capital and
which companies to invest in.
 Monitoring and engagement strategies:
When challenging investee companies’
boards and management on their
strategies to generate long-term
sustainable value; and when setting
clear expectations and monitoring the
investment managers, intermediaries
and those that support stewardship and
operate on their behalf.
 Escalation and collaboration: By
collaborating with other investors, firms
can amplify their stewardship, especially
for smaller investors and pension funds.
 Voting practices: When exercising
their shareholder rights; this includes
being ready to vote against directors,
corporate actions, or other resolutions.

Government and regulator action
to support investment stewardship
to date
As well as being a centre of financial services
excellence, the UK is also a world-leader
in stewardship standards. The government
strongly supports this agenda and is
working hard to further improve and embed
stewardship standards.
The UK Stewardship Code 2020
The UK Stewardship Code 202011 sets
stewardship and reporting standards for asset
owners, asset managers and the service
providers that support them. The FRC is the
first regulator to require investors to evidence
their commitment to effective stewardship
by reporting on an annual basis. The FRC
published the first list of successful signatories
to the new Code in September 2021, covering
£20 trillion assets under management.
The FRC will continue to encourage the
development of a market for effective
stewardship and high-quality disclosure.
In November 2021, the FRC will publish a
review of reporting to highlight effective
examples and communicate its expectations
for 2022. By the end of 2022 the FRC will
communicate an approach to differentiating
or tiering signatories based on the quality of
their reporting.
The Asset Management Taskforce’s
Stewardship Report
In November 2020, the Economic Secretary to
the Treasury’s Asset Management Taskforce
published Investing With Purpose12. This report
was produced by a wide range of industry,
regulator, and government representatives. It
rigorously analyses the tools available to help
asset managers act on behalf of savers and
hold investee companies to account.
The report also makes clear recommendations
to government, regulators, and industry, which
apply across the investment chain. These
will further enhance the UK’s stewardship
framework and practice. The government
has already taken forward several of these
recommendations, in particular by launching
the Occupational Pension Stewardship
Council13 in July 2021. The Council represents
over £570 billion of assets, and provides a
forum for schemes to collaborate, develop a
stronger voice for trustees and drive higher
standards of stewardship.
Industry is progressing several other
recommendations from Investing
With Purpose, notably guidance
on improving stewardship in fixed
income and on overcoming barriers to
requisitioning resolutions.
The Taskforce on Pension Scheme Voting
and Implementation’s report (TPSVI)
Launched in December 2020, the TPSVI
issued its independent report in September
2021. This aims to strengthen the use of
voting throughout the investment chain. It
suggested measures to improve pension
scheme trustees’ focus on stewardship and
enhance asset manager reporting standards
and accommodation of trustees’ voting
preferences. DWP has welcomed the report
and will respond soon.
FCA priorities on investor stewardship
The FCA considers stewardship to be
integral to asset managers delivering good
outcomes for clients and consumers. The
FCA Handbook requires firms to disclose
their commitment to the FRC’s Stewardship
Code, or alternative strategy. The FCA also
introduced rules in 2019 implementing the
Shareholder Rights Directive II, requiring asset
managers and life insurers to disclose their
engagement policies. The FCA is scoping
work to realise the regulatory outcomes
prioritised in its Business Plan 2021/22. This
includes active investor stewardship that
positively influences companies’ sustainability
strategies, supporting a market-led transition
to a more sustainable future.

12 Established in October 2017 and chaired by the Economic Secretary, the Asset Management Taskforce regularly convenes senior leaders
in the asset management sector, stakeholder organisations and the Financial Conduct Authority to discuss the opportunities and challenges
facing the sector.

Government expectations
The UK’s pensions and investment sectors
have made clear that, in order to effectively
target and engage with firms on climate
change and act as responsible stewards,
investee companies must disclose decisionrelevant information. SDR will ensure that
investee companies disclose that information,
and government and industry’s stewardship
initiatives will lower the barriers to investors
acting as effective stewards.
Therefore, it is the government’s expectation
that, as this information becomes available
and develops over time, the UK’s pensions
and investment sectors – asset managers,
asset owners and the service providers that
support them – will have the data to act as
effective and responsible stewards of capital.
In particular, the government expects the UK’s
pensions and investment sectors to:
1. Progress work on stewardship within
their organisation; apply to become a
signatory of the UK Stewardship Code
2020; and encourage or require their
service providers to sign up to the Code.
2. Take into account the information
generated by SDR when
allocating capital.
3. Actively monitor, encourage, and
challenge companies by using their
rights and direct/indirect influence
to promote long-term, sustainable
value generation.
In some cases, the exercise of
stewardship discipline may eventually
escalate to withholding capital or
divestment. For example, where a
company is not taking appropriate action
to transition to net zero.
4. Be transparent about their own and their
service providers’ engagement and
voting, including by publishing easily
accessible, high-quality quantitative and
narrative reporting.
5. Provide leadership, for example by
joining a Race to Zero-accredited net
zero initiative for the financial sector,
and thereby joining GFANZ. They should
back up this commitment by publishing
by the end of 2022 a high-quality
transition plan. This should include nearterm science-based targets and set out
their organisation’s pathway to net zero
financed emissions.
The government will assess progress in
these sectors on the above five points at
the end of 2023.
32
Chapter 4: Leading
international efforts to
green finance
33
Tackling climate change and other
environmental challenges needs more
than just domestic action. That is why the
government has made green finance an
international priority, using our influential
position to drive progress in both bilateral
and multilateral fora. This year is a particularly
important one in the international calendar,
with the UK holding both the G7 presidency
and hosting COP26.
As part of the G7, the government brought
climate and environmental issues to the
forefront of policy discussions between
finance ministries. This was the first time
these challenges featured prominently in
the Finance Track. The government worked
closely with the Bank of England to secure
ambitious commitments from G7 members
on sustainability reporting. This included
agreement to move towards mandatory
climate disclosures, to support the IFRS
Foundation’s programme of work to develop a
baseline global corporate reporting standard
for sustainability, and to promote consistency
in impact reporting standards.
Many of these issues were subsequently taken
up in the G20, particularly by the Sustainable
Finance Working Group (SFWG), of which
the UK is an active member. The SFWG
has driven progress against sustainability
reporting and discussed approaches to align
investments with sustainability goals. The
UK is also a member of the International
Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF), which
aims to foster consistency in environmental
impact reporting.
During the UK G7 presidency, the government
also announced an Impact Investment
Taskforce, to bring together the impact
investing industry. The taskforce will
make recommendations on harmonising
and streamlining measurements of social
or environmental impacts of financial
investments simply, transparently and in a
globally consistent way. This will make it
easier for all investors to invest based on
impact as well as financial return.
The government is also working to support
Emerging Market and Developing Economies
(EMDEs) to benefit from the global green
transition. There are huge economic
development, adaptation and resilience
opportunities, but if not well managed, it
could have negative consequences such
as divestment or capital flight. The UK will
continue to support the EDMEs through
technical assistance and targeted investments
to mobilise greater flows of green capital. The
government will also press for developing
countries to be represented in international
decision-making, including the shaping
of international disclosures standards on
sustainability.
The Bank of England and the FCA are active
in multilateral fora, such as the Network for
Greening the Financial System (NGFS) – a
group of Central Banks and Supervisors,
of which the Bank is a founding member –
and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The
FCA has also engaged closely with the IFRS
Foundation in its work to establish the ISSB.
COP26 is the next international milestone
in sustainable finance. Under the Paris
Agreement, Parties committed to making
finance flows consistent with a pathway
towards low greenhouse gas emissions and
climate-resilient development. To do so, the
entire financial system needs to transform, to
lock financial flows irreversibly into a pathway
to net zero.14 Ahead of COP, the UK is working
closely with international partners to galvanise
global action:
 Ensuring that market participants have
the information they need to factor
climate-change into every investment
decision – via disclosure of climate
impact, risks and opportunities.
 Ensuring that the financial system can
measure and manage climate-related
risks, including through climate scenario
analysis and improved climate capture in
surveillance work.
34
14 In 2020, the UK published our COP26 goals on Finance: Building a Private Finance System For Net Zero which set out our private finance
priorities for COP26 and Priorities for Public Climate Finance in the Year Ahead which set out our public finance priorities for COP26
 Measuring how investment is aligned to
the transition to net-zero, by developing
more sophisticated, transparent, and
consumer-friendly metrics.
 Driving firms’ longer-term net-zero
commitments by setting out credible
transition plans (which include nearterm decarbonisation targets), requiring
regular progress reporting, and providing
supervisory oversight and accountability.
The government, financial regulators, and
the UK financial sector are working in close
partnership to make this ambition a reality. For
example in April 2021 GFANZ launched as a
global alliance that brings together existing
and new net zero finance initiatives into one
sector-wide strategic forum.
The UK wants to ensure that its domestic
regulation represents international best
practice. This strong domestic action,
coupled with international influencing, will
ensure that the UK remains a global leader
in green finance after COP26 and help to
move the world towards delivering the global
commitments in the Paris Agreement.
35
Chapter 5:
Next steps
This Roadmap outlines the actions the UK
government and regulators are taking -
working in partnership with the private sector
- to close the information gap for market
participants on sustainability by:
 Implementing Sustainability Disclosure
Requirements (SDR) across the
economy – introducing disclosures
incrementally as new regulatory or
legislative measures come into force
 Delivering a UK Green Taxonomy and
ensuring it has been road-tested in the
market as a useful investment tool.
 Lowering the barriers to investors
acting as effective and responsible
stewards of capital
 Leading international efforts to bring
about global and systemic change in
the financial system
With clarity on the indicative path towards
economy-wide disclosures, businesses and
financial firms must now consider the steps
they need to take to build their capabilities
to produce disclosures, and to act on the
information they provide. Working together,
the government and industry can make the
UK the best place in the world for green and
sustainable investment.

Annex A: Sectoral
implementation
The sectoral pathways in this annex summarise the regulatory approach to each type of
entity and product.
1. CORPORATE DISCLOSURE
Certain UK-registered companies and listed issuers, including financial services firms, will
disclose information about how they identify, assess, and manage sustainability factors arising
from their global operations in their Annual Reports.
a. UK-registered companies 
Certain companies – including relevant financial services firms – will disclose information using
the proposed ISSB-issued standards and appropriate metrics to explain the level of alignment
of their activities with the UK Green Taxonomy, including minimum safeguards, in their Annual
Report. The scope and timing of requirements for companies, and the reporting detail, will be
determined following consultation.
b. UK-listed companies
Certain UK-listed companies will disclose information using the proposed ISSB-issued standards,
and appropriate metrics to explain the level of alignment of their activities with the UK Green
Taxonomy, including minimum safeguards, in their Annual Report. The scope and timing of
requirements for issuers, and the reporting detail, will be determined following consultation.
Interim measures may be considered – e.g. referencing relevant voluntary frameworks – to
ensure appropriate coverage of sustainability topics pending the introduction of relevant
international standards.
2. ASSET MANAGER AND ASSET OWNER DISCLOSURE
Financial services firms that manage or administer money for investors will disclose the
sustainability-related information that clients (e.g. pension scheme trustees, employers, corporate
investors) and end-consumers (e.g. pension scheme members, retail investors) need to make
informed decisions about their investments. This information will relate to how firms manage and
administer money.
a. Asset managers and asset owners (asset managers, life insurers providing investment
products and FCA-regulated pension schemes)
Asset managers and asset owners will disclose, at entity level, how they are managing their
sustainability risks, opportunities and impacts and how they take sustainability into account in
managing or administering investments on behalf of clients and consumers. This information will
be directed towards their clients and consumers. The disclosure requirements will build on TCFD
requirements and support disclosures against the UK Green Taxonomy. The exact location, scope
and timing, and the detail of disclosure requirements, will be determined following consultation.
38
b. Occupational pension schemes
Certain UK pension schemes will disclose their sustainability-related risks, opportunities
and impacts in a way that enables clear communication with savers. Subject to consultation,
information will be combined with TCFD reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities,
and will stand separate from, but linked to, the annual report and accounts. The scope and
timing of requirements for pension schemes, and the reporting detail, will be determined
following consultation.
3. INVESTMENT PRODUCT DISCLOSURE
Firms will disclose, at product level, the sustainability-related information that consumers need
to make informed decisions about their investments. Disclosures will be consumer-friendly, with
more detailed disclosures required for sophisticated investors.
a. Investment products
Firms will disclose the sustainability attributes of the investment products and portfolios they
offer. This will include their sustainability risks, opportunities and impacts, a core set of productlevel climate-related metrics, and their Taxonomy alignment, including minimum safeguards. Both
products marketed as sustainable and those not making sustainability claims will be required to
disclose information about their sustainability performance. Investment products that make claims
about the sustainability of their product will be required to substantiate those claims, for example
with information about their sustainable investment strategy and performance against their
sustainability targets. The FCA intends to consult on the detail of the disclosure requirements,
including content, scope, format, and location.
Sustainable investment labelling regime
The FCA is working with the government to develop and implement a sustainable investment
labelling system for investment products. The labels will provide a classification system for
investment products supported by the information provided in their sustainability disclosures.
These labels will help consumers intuitively navigate the sustainability characteristics of
different products, both those that are marketed as sustainable, and those that are not. The
key design elements of the labels and classification will be determined following a discussion
paper and subsequent consultation, as well as input from an advisory group that will be
established in due course.
4. FINANCIAL ADVISORS
HM Treasury and the FCA are exploring how best to introduce sustainability-related requirements
for financial advisors. A key aim will be to ensure that they take sustainability matters into
account in their investment advice and understand investors’ sustainability preferences to ensure
suitability of advice. Details of the proposals are subject to further consideration and will be set
out on a different timescale to proposals for financial market participants. The proposals will be
subject to consultation and cost benefit analysis.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) – the United Nations
body for assessing the science related to
climate change. The IPCC provides regular
assessments of the scientific basis of climate
change, its impacts and future risks, and
options for adaptation and mitigation.

International Sustainability Standards Board
(ISSB) – proposed body being established
by the IFRS Foundation to develop global
sustainability reporting standards.
Nature positive – enhancing the resilience
of our planet and societies to halt and
reverse nature loss.
Net Zero emissions – Sometimes known
as Net Zero Carbon or just Net Zero, this
describes a state where any CO2 and
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions left
over after decarbonisation are offset by
negative emissions of an equivalent amount
of CO2 from the atmosphere, resulting in
no net GHG impact. The offsets need to
actively remove carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, as opposed to only avoiding
emissions elsewhere which is allowed in the
specification for carbon neutral. There is not
yet an agreed standard on what constitutes
Net Zero Carbon for an organisation, product,
or country, although there are multiple
organisations with working definitions, for
example, the Science Based Targets Initiative.
Task Force for Climate-Related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) – a private sector led
group convened by the Financial Stability
Board in 2015 to “develop voluntary,
consistent climate-related financial disclosures
that would be useful to investors, lenders
and insurance underwriters in understanding
material risks”.
Categories of ESG Investing (as referenced in Figure D):
Impact Investing – Investments made with
the intention to generate positive, measurable
social and environmental impact alongside a
financial return. There are four key elements: 1.
Intentionality: Impact investments intentionally
contribute to social and environmental
solutions. This differentiates them from other
strategies such as ESG investing, Responsible
Investing, and screening strategies. 2.
Financial Returns: Impact investments seek a
financial return on capital that can range from
below market rate to risk-adjusted market rate.
This distinguishes them from philanthropy. 3.
Range of Asset Classes: Impact investments
can be made across asset classes. 4. Impact
Measurement: A hallmark of impact investing
is the commitment of the investor to measure
and report the social and environmental
performance of underlying investments.
Sustainability Focused – Investment
approaches that select and include
investments on the basis of their fulfilling
certain sustainability criteria and/or delivering
on specific and measurable sustainability
outcome(s). Investments are chosen on the
basis of their economic activities (what they
produce/what services they deliver) and on
their business conduct (how they deliver their
products and services).
Exclusions – Exclusions prohibit certain
investments from a firm, fund or portfolio.
Exclusions may be applied on a variety
of issues, including to align with client
expectations. They may be applied at the
level of Sector, Business activity, products or
revenue stream, A company or Jurisdictions/
countries. Exclusions determine that a fund
or mandate does NOT invest in certain
things. It does not constitute an approach
that is characterised by proactively allocating
capital to specific assets. It may involve
excluding investments from a certain
sector or investments that derive a portion
of their income from the sale of certain
specified products.
ESG Integration – The systematic and
explicit inclusion of material ESG factors into
investment analysis and investment decisions.
ESG Integration alone does not prohibit any
investments. Such strategies could invest in
any business, sector or geography as long
as the ESG risks of such investments are
identified and taken into account.
