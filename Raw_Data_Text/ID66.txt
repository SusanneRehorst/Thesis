                                 AN ACT


 
  To provide for disclosure of additional material information about 
     public companies and establish a Sustainable Finance Advisory 
                   Committee, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Corporate Governance Improvement and 
Investor Protection Act''.

                 TITLE I--ESG DISCLOSURE SIMPLIFICATION

SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``ESG Disclosure Simplification Act 
of 2021''.

SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Securities and Exchange Commission has broad 
        authority to require the disclosure of information if such 
        information is in the interest of, or is material to investors.
            (2) The Commission does not require companies to disclose 
        information related to environmental, social, and governance 
        (``ESG'') matters, and does not require companies to adhere to 
        standards for disclosing such information.
            (3) Investors have reported that voluntary disclosures of 
        ESG metrics are inadequate.
            (4) A rule requiring reporting and standardization of ESG 
        disclosures is in the interest of investors.
            (5) ESG matters are material to investors, and the 
        Commission must establish standards for disclosure of such 
        matters.

SEC. 103. ESG DISCLOSURES.

    (a) In General.--Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(15 U.S.C. 78n) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(k) ESG Disclosures.--
            ``(1) In general.--Each issuer the securities of which are 
        registered under section 12 or that is required to file annual 
        reports under section 15(d) shall disclose in any proxy or 
        consent solicitation material for an annual meeting of the 
        shareholders--
                    ``(A) a clear description of the views of the 
                issuer about the link between ESG metrics and the long-
                term business strategy of the issuer; and
                    ``(B) a description of any process the issuer uses 
                to determine the impact of ESG metrics on the long-term 
                business strategy of the issuer.
            ``(2) ESG metrics defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        `ESG metrics' has the meaning given the term in part 210 of 
        title 17, Code of Federal Regulations as amended pursuant to 
        section 3(b) of the ESG Disclosure Simplification Act of 
        2021.''.
    (b) Rulemaking.--
            (1) In general.--The Securities and Exchange Commission (in 
        this Act referred to as the ``Commission'') shall amend part 
        210 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor 
        thereto) to--
                    (A) require each issuer, in any filing of the 
                issuer described in such part that requires audited 
                financial statements, to disclose environmental, 
                social, and governance metrics (in this title referred 
                to as ESG metrics); and
                    (B) define ESG metrics.
            (2) Sustainable finance advisory committee.--The 
        Sustainable Finance Advisory Committee established pursuant to 
        section 4(k) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 shall, 
        not later than 180 days after the date of the first meeting of 
        such Committee, submit to the Commission recommendations about 
        what ESG metrics the Commission should require issuers to 
        disclose.
            (3) Materiality.--It is the sense of Congress that ESG 
        metrics, as such term is defined by the Commission pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), are de facto material for the purposes of 
        disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the 
        Securities Act of 1933.
            (4) Incorporation of international standards.--When 
        amending part 210 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations (or 
        any successor thereto) pursuant to paragraph (1), the 
        Commission may, as the Commission determines appropriate, 
        incorporate any internationally recognized, independent, multi-
        stakeholder environmental, social, and governance disclosure 
        standards.
            (5) Location of disclosure.--Any disclosure required by 
        paragraph (1) may be included in a notes section of the filing.
            (6) Delay for small issuers.--The Commission may use a 
        phased approach when applying any amendments made pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) to small issuers and may determine the criteria 
        by which an issuer qualifies as a small issuer for purposes of 
        such phased approach.

SEC. 203. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

    Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m)

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 402. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) climate change poses a significant and increasing 
        threat to the growth and stability of the economy of the United 
        States;
            (2) many sectors of the economy of the United States and 
        many American businesses are exposed to climate-related risk, 
        which may include exposure to--
                    (A) the physical impacts of climate change, 
                including the rise of the average global temperature, 
                accelerating sea-level rise, desertification, ocean 
                acidification, intensification of storms, increase in 
                heavy precipitation, more frequent and intense 
                temperature extremes, more severe droughts, and longer 
                wildfire seasons;
                    (B) the economic disruptions and security threats 
                that result from the physical impacts described in 
                subparagraph (A) including conflicts over scarce 
                resources, conditions conducive to violent extremism, 
                the spread of infectious diseases, and forced 
                migration;
                    (C) the transition impacts that result as the 
                global economy transitions to a clean and renewable 
                energy, low-emissions economy, including financial 
                impacts as climate change fossil fuel assets becoming 
                stranded and it becomes uneconomic for companies to 
                develop fossil fuel assets as policymakers act to limit 
                the worst impacts of climate change by keeping the rise 
                in average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius 
                above pre-industrial levels; and
                    (D) actions by Federal, State, Tribal, territorial, 
                and local governments to limit the worst effects of 
                climate change by enacting policies that keep the 
                global average surface temperature rise to 1.5 degrees 
                Celsius above pre-industrial levels;
            (3) assessing the potential impact of climate-related risks 
        on national and international financial systems is an urgent 
        concern;
            (4) companies have a duty to disclose financial risks that 
        climate change presents to their investors, lenders, and 
        insurers;
            (5) the Securities and Exchange Commission has a duty to 
        promote a risk-informed securities market that is worthy of the 
        trust of the public as families invest for their futures;
            (6) investors, lenders, and insurers are increasingly 
        demanding climate risk information that is consistent, 
        comparable, reliable, and clear;
            (7) including standardized, material climate change risk 
        and opportunity disclosure that is useful for decision makers 
        in annual reports to the Commission will increase transparency 
        with respect to risk accumulation and exposure in financial 
        markets;
            (8) requiring companies to disclose climate-related risk 
        exposure and risk management strategies will encourage a 
        smoother transition to a clean and renewable energy, low-
        emissions economy and guide capital allocation to mitigate, and 
        adapt to, the effects of climate change and limit damages 
        associated with climate-related events and disasters; and
            (9) a critical component in fighting climate change is a 
        transparent accounting of the risks that climate change 
        presents and the implications of continued inaction with 
        respect to climate change.

               TITLE VI--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT DISCLOSURE

SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Workforce Investment Disclosure 
Act of 2021''.

SEC. 602. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) One of the keys to the 20th century post-war economic 
        success of the United States was the ability to prepare workers 
        over the course of their lives for success through multiple 
        sectors across society. Unfortunately, during the several 
        decades preceding the date of enactment of this Act, there has 
        been a shift in business norms and in society. While Congress 
        recognizes that the technology and job skills required for some 
        jobs has changed dramatically, the private and public 
        partnership to hire workers at different education levels and 
        invest in them for the long-term is broken.
            (2) Available data from the 10-year period preceding the 
        date of enactment of this Act suggests that businesses are 
        investing less in worker training during that time period, not 
        more.
            (3) In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, there 
        was a well-documented decline in overall business investment. 
        That decline coincides with the wage polarization of workers 
        and an increase in spending on share buybacks and dividends, 
        leading several researchers to conclude that companies are de-
        emphasizing investment at the expense of increasing returns for 
        shareholders. The onset of a global pandemic may make that 
        trend worse, especially with respect to investments in workers.
            (4) As part of the overall decline in investment described 
        in paragraph (3), publicly traded companies are being provided 
        with incentives to prioritize investments in physical assets 
        over investments in their workforces, meaning that those 
        companies are investing in robots instead of individuals. In 
        fact, there are already signs that automation has increased 
        during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            (5) More than ever, the Federal Government, through company 
        disclosure practices, needs to understand exactly how companies 
        are investing in their workers. Over the several months 
        preceding the date of enactment of this Act, companies across 
        the United States have taken extreme actions to adapt and 
        respond to evolving workforce challenges presented by COVID-19.
            (6) JUST Capital has been tracking the responses of the 
        Standard and Poor's 100 largest public companies to their 
        workers and has found wide variation in the policies 
        implemented, as well as with respect to the disclosure of those 
        policies. Through different responses to their workforces, from 
        layoffs to workplace safety to paid leave, the COVID-19 
        pandemic is exposing the myriad ways that workforce management 
        practices of companies pose operational and reputational risks 
        for short- and long-term financial performance.
            (7) Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a growing 
        body of research establishing a relationship between measurable 
        workforce management, which is the way that companies manage 
        their employees, and firm performance. In a study of 2,000 
        large companies, Harvard Law School's Labor and Work Life 
        Program found that forward-thinking workforce policies that 
        prioritize workers, such as how companies train, retain, and 
        pay their workers, are correlated with long-term financial 
        performance.
            (8) Disclosure of workforce management policies should be 
        part of a Government-wide economic recovery strategy. Just as a 
        set of generally accepted accounting principles (commonly known 
        as ``GAAP'') was urgently adopted after the Great Depression, 
        standardized, comparable metrics of workforce disclosure 
        requirements in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are 
        critical for investors to accurately measure and project 
        company performance, both in the present and in the future.
            (9) Because many companies already track workforce metrics 
        internally, moving towards a transparent disclosure regime 
        would allow investors to better judge whether companies are 
        managing risks and making the investments in their workforces 
        that are needed for long-term growth.
            (10) Businesses increasingly rely on workforce innovation 
        and intellectual capital for competitiveness. Workplace 
        benefits, particularly paid sick leave, medical leave, and 
        flexible work arrangements, critically support employee mental 
        and physical well-being.
            (11) Race- and gender-based workplace discrimination have 
        been tied to negative health outcomes, as well as lower 
        productivity, trust, morale, and satisfaction and higher rates 
        of absenteeism and turnover. Organizational reporting on 
        practices to reduce discrimination can increase employee job 
        satisfaction, performance, and engagement.
            (12) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, work-related stress is the leading occupational 
        health risk and, per the American Institute of Stress, job 
        stress costs United States industry more than $300,000,000,000 
        per year in accidents, absenteeism, employee turnover, 
        diminished productivity, and medical, legal, and insurance 
        costs.
            (13) Employee health and well-being is a key asset to 
        delivering long-term value, with 80 percent of public companies 
        that took concrete actions on health and well-being having seen 
        larger improvements in financial performance.
            (14) Organizational well-being interventions can create 
        cost savings of up to 10 dollars for every dollar invested. 
        Specifically, for every dollar that employers spend on 
        workplace disease prevention and well-being programs, there is 
        a $3.27 reduction in employee medical costs and a $2.73 
        reduction in absenteeism costs. Employers that implement 
        workplace health promotion programs have seen reductions in 
        sick leave, health plan costs, and workers' compensation and 
        disability insurance costs of approximately 25 percent.
            (15) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
        found that preventable chronic conditions are a major 
        contributor to insurance premium and employee medical claim 
        costs, which are at an all-time high, and a Milken Institute 
        study shows that employers paid $2,600,000,000,000 in 2016 for 
        the indirect costs of employee chronic disease due to work 
        absences, lost wages, and reduced economic productivity.
            (16) The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted employee 
        physical, mental, and emotional well-being by increasing 
        stress, depression, burnout, and mortality rates of chronic 
        disease and by reducing work-life balance and financial 
        security, with these challenges likely to persist due to 
        uncertainty and instability even as employees return to work. 
        Before the COVID-19 pandemic, but especially in the face of 
        that pandemic, employers that advance policies and practices 
        that support workforce health, safety, and well-being are 
        likely to outperform competitors and benefit from lower costs.
