Annex 2
Corporate Governance Report on compliance with the Corporate Governance Recommendations
As part of the Corporate Governance Report, the Company makes a statement regarding the extent to which it has implemented in its own corporate governance practice the recommendations and proposals specified in the relevant sections of the Corporate Governance Recommendations issued by the Budapest Stock Exchange Ltd., by completing the following tables.
These tables provide an overview for the investors of the extent of the compliance - by the relevant company - with certain requirements set out in the Corporate Governance Recommendations at glance, and enable easy comparison of the practices of the specific companies.
The Recommendations contain both recommendations that are binding for all issuers and non-binding proposals. Issuers may derogate both from binding recommendations and non-binding proposals. In the event of derogation from the recommendations, issuers are required to publish and justify the derogation in their corporate governance reports (‘comply or explain’). This enables issuers to take industry and company-specific requirements into account. Accordingly, even issuers derogating from the recommendations can comply with corporate governance requirements under specific circumstances. Concerning the proposals, issuers should indicate whether they apply a given guideline or not, and they can also explain any derogation from the proposals.
The basic principle and purpose of the corporate governance report is to have companies give a report of their previous business year and to reveal the measure of their compliance with the Recommendations. The Recommendations may, however, include recommendations and proposals relating to events which did not occur at the issuer in the given period. In accordance with the current practice, these ‘event type’ questions can be answered with ‘YES’ also when the relevant event did not occur in the business year (for instance, no dividend was paid, or no shareholders’ comments were received for the proposals to be submitted prior to the General Meeting) if the Company would have responded to the occurrences of such events as set forth in the Recommendations, in line with the provisions of its Articles of Association or its practices. In a situation like that, the solution that comes closest to the principle of transparent operation is for the issuer to select YES and also to add an explanation that though the event in question did not occur in the previous business year, there are appropriate mechanisms in place to handle it.
