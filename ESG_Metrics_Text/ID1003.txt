Rationale
An outcome-oriented measure of board and management quality, this disclosure focuses on the company’s
achievement of its stated objectives. This disclosure combines both leading and lagging indicators of the
board’s oversight and management’s ability to set, guide and execute the company’s strategy.
Additional commentary
Achievement of strategic milestones in the past year provides a useful proxy of the board’s and
management’s ability to oversee the organization’s achievement of its strategic objectives, including
purpose. Strategic milestones for the year ahead allow stakeholders to more effectively evaluate the
quality of decision-making by the board and management and the extent to which that decision-making is
consistent with the purpose and objectives of the firm.
