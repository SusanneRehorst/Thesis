Resource circularity
Report the most appropriate resource circularity metric(s) for
the whole company and/or at a product, material or site level as
applicable. Potential metrics include (but are not limited to) the
Circular Transition Indicators (WBCSD), indicators developed by
the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and company developed metrics.
Disclose the methodological approach used to calculate the
chosen circularity metric(s) and the rationale for the choice of
metric(s).

Rationale
Metrics for reporting on resource circularity have not yet been standardized but some promising example
metrics have been developed and tested by multiple companies. Applying emerging circularity metrics and
disclosing the results will help to progress this fundamentally important area. It also indicates proactive
engagement with the risks and opportunities presented by the circular transition and can be used to
demonstrate progress towards genuine resource sustainability.
Additional commentary
Example organization-level circularity metrics include the Circular Transition Indicators developed by the
WBCSD43 including percentage of circular inflow and percentage of circular outflow of resources.
Circular inflow can be calculated as follows:
(weight of renewable inflow + weight of non-virgin inflow / total weight of all inflow) x 100%
Circular outflow is calculated as follows, per material flow:
((% recovery potential x % actual recovery) x weight) / total weight of all outflow
