oversight
Economic, environmental and social topics in capital allocation
framework
How the highest governance body considers economic,
environmental and social issues when overseeing major capital
allocation decisions, such as expenditures, acquisitions and
divestments.
CDSB REQ-02
Rationale
This disclosure is an important way to gauge the quality of risk and opportunity oversight and the extent to
which it incorporates economic, environmental and social considerations. Capital allocation is at the core
of any business model and illustrates the companyâ€™s longer-term priorities; as such it is a leading indicator
of long-term value creation.
Additional commentary
Robust governance of both risks and opportunities, with the goal of long-term value creation, must
engage with the way those risks and opportunities are embedded in the business.
