Skills for the
future
Monetized impacts of training – Increased earning capacity as a
result of training intervention (%, $)
1. Investment in training as a percentage (%) of payroll.
2. Effectiveness of the training and development through
increased revenue, productivity gains, employee engagement
and/or internal hire rates.
Adapted from
OECD, 47 48
WDI 5.5
Rationale
Training affects valuation and creates a pressure for change. It can be leveraged for innovation and used to
improve performance and manage human capital. Enhancing skills through relevant investments in training
and monitoring the effectiveness of training will enhance productivity, reduce employee turnover and
contribute to an organization’s capacity to create long-term value.
Additional commentary
1. Report on the investment made in training as a percentage of payroll. This analyses how much
reskilling investment is made to enhance the capabilities of the workforce and make them future-ready.
2. Companies are encouraged to provide any quantitative or qualitative measures of the impact of training
and development on the business and its workforce (e.g. through increased revenue, productivity
gains, employee engagement and/or internal hire rates or return on investment). Regarding internal
hires, report the proportion of internal hires at company level and proportion by employee category.
For reporting on training return on investment, use the DJSI human capital return on investment
methodology or the Kirkpatrick Model.
