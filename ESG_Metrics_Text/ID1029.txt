Dignity and
equality
Pay equality (%)
Ratio of the basic salary and remuneration for each employee
category by significant locations of operation for priority areas
of equality: women to men, minor to major ethnic groups, and
other relevant equality areas.
Adapted from
GRI 405-2
Rationale
Corporate policies promoting pay equality reflect an organization’s culture and help companies bridge
diversity gaps, attract talent and drive long-term competitiveness. Inclusion and diversity can only be
achieved by promoting equal pay and by providing equal remuneration for the same jobs, to address
social disparity and to maximize professional opportunities for all people irrespective of gender, colour,
caste, creed, religion and other diversity aspects. Organizations in which racial and other discrimination
imbalances exist expose themselves to reputational and potential legal risk.
Additional commentary
Refer to the guidance provided in the GRI Standard 405 for reporting on this metric. For reporting on
ethnic pay equality, adopt a methodology similar to GRI 405-2, focusing on ethnic groups. The major and
minor ethnic group would be based on the significant locations of organizations’ operations.
