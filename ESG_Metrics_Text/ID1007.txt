Ethical behaviour Protected ethics advice and reporting mechanisms
A description of internal and external mechanisms for:
1. Seeking advice about ethical and lawful behaviour and
organizational integrity; and
2. Reporting concerns about unethical or unlawful behaviour
and lack of organizational integrity.
GRI 102-17
Rationale
This disclosure focuses on the ongoing ability of a company to both prevent and remedy ethical issues.
Additional commentary
This disclosure identifies the mechanisms (e.g. whistleblowing procedures) in place to receive input on
ethics topics and reports of potential issues, and the ways in which these mechanisms are managed or
protected to encourage robust advice and reporting. Protected ethics advice and reporting mechanisms
demonstrate an authentic intent by the board and management to explain and promote ethical and legal
conduct and prevent unethical or illegal conduct. This disclosure was chosen for its universal applicability
and allows for comparison and evaluation of board commitment to the oversight of ethical behaviour.
Without a mechanism for employees and other key stakeholders to ask questions about or to report
potential or actual unethical or unlawful behaviour, companies may miss opportunities to identify and
mitigate underlying issues. Companies that encourage their stakeholders to provide feedback can respond
more quickly to misconduct, build trust with their stakeholders and prevent harm to long-term value.
