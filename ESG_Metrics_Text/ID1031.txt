Rationale
Child labour and forced or compulsory labour are violations of fundamental human rights and have been
identified as a hindrance to development. There is a strong link between poverty and child labour, which
can lower the standard of living across generations. The ripple effects arising from these issues can
translate into legal and reputational risk for the companies, especially those with extensive value chains.
Eliminating child labour, forced labour and human trafficking requires businesses, financial institutions
and civil society to take strong action and address its root causes. This indicator provides an overview of
where a company is identifying these significant human rights risks and gives the company the opportunity
to explain its approach to risk management of these issues and how it is addressing these risks in the
entire value chain.
