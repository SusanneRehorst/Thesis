Rationale
A safe workplace is crucial for companies to maintain employees’ morale and stay competitive. The
financial impacts of workplace accidents can destabilize companies and their business models. Measuring
the direct impacts of these accidents will enable companies to reduce their negative impacts on
employees, business and society. The cost of work-related accidents and ill-health helps substantiate the
business case for investments in occupational health and safety.
Additional commentary
Report on monetized impacts incurred due to work-related incidents during the reporting period. Calculate
by multiplying the number and type of occupational incidents (e.g. injuries to employees, structural
damage in the organization etc.) with direct costs incurred by the organization. This includes costs directly
attributed to the accident, e.g. direct costs from compensation payments, first aid and medical expenses,
wages of the victim, material damages, payment of indemnity benefits, workers’ compensation and other
benefits, medical benefits for the injured worker (e.g. workers’ compensation and other health benefits),
return-to-work programmes, workers’ compensation insurance premiums, injury prevention programmes,
and costs of compliance, among others.
