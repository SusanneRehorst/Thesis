Air pollution Air pollution
Report wherever material along the value chain: nitrogen oxides
(NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), particulate matter and other
significant air emissions.
Wherever possible estimate the proportion of specified
emissions that occur in or adjacent to urban/densely
populated areas.
GRI 305-7
Rationale
Localized air pollution, in the form of fine particulate matter and oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, is a leading
cause of ill-health and premature death around the world. Emissions in densely populated areas tend to be
particularly harmful because they contribute to high ambient concentrations of pollution and affect a large
number of people.
