Setting purpose

means by which a business proposes solutions to economic,
environmental and social issues. Corporate purpose should
create value for all stakeholders, including shareholders.

Rationale
Oversight of a company’s chosen priorities in terms of economic, environmental and social issues requires
a clear understanding and articulation of the firm’s purpose. The more that firms can link their purpose and
core business, the better they can deliver long-term value for all stakeholders, including shareholders.
Additional commentary
There is emerging evidence that purpose-led firms outperform their peers in terms of shareholder value32
and are better positioned to account for and deliver economic, environmental and social value.
This disclosure calls for the articulation of the output of a process to formulate and publicize a purpose,
providing a useful baseline for whether firms are pursuing purpose or not. This disclosure was selected
over alternatives, including measures of investment aligned to purpose and the extent to which culture is
aligned to purpose, to reflect the primary need that still exists to comprehensively articulate purpose and
its link to economic, environmental and social value and long-term value creation. It is fundamental to
purpose-led outcomes, helps establish comparability across businesses and is the essential first step in
becoming a purpose-led business.
Purpose should define how a company creates value by addressing solutions to economic, environmental
and social issues, and ensures that it is not profiting from creating problems in these domains
