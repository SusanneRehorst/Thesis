Rationale
Organizational culture needs to be built on a foundation of respect, courtesy and professionalism, free
from any acts of discrimination, bullying or harassment. Employers are responsible for dealing effectively
and fairly with situations involving claims and incidents of harassment or discrimination. Commitment
to eliminating discrimination and harassment in the workplace helps reduce inequalities and promotes
organizational cultures that focus on performance and merit.
