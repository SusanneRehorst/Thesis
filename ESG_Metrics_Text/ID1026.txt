Rationale
Reporting valued impact in monetary terms provides a meaningful indication of the scale of impacts in units
that can be readily understood by executives and compared across impact areas and with financial figures.
Valuation of environmental impacts is increasingly recognized as the most efficient and effective way of
incorporating as much relevant contextual information as possible to provide estimates of actual impact,
rather than simply measures of output as is the case with most quantitative environmental metrics.
