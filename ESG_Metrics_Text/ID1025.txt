Solid waste Single-use plastics
Report wherever material along the value chain: estimated metric
tonnes of single-use plastic consumed.
Disclose the most significant applications of single-use plastic
identified, the quantification approach used and the definition of
single-use plastic adopted.
New metric
Rationale
Metrics for reporting on single-use plastics have not yet been standardized, but the global scale of negative
impacts associated with their use is sufficient to justify additional investigation of corporate value chains
to identify their principal applications and the scale of their use. Experimenting with measurement will help
the company understand its exposure to an issue of high public concern, and disclosing the results and
approach will help to advance understanding of the issues more widely
