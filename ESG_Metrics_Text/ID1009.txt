Ethical behaviour Monetary losses from unethical behaviour
Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings
associated with fraud, insider trading, anti-trust, anti-competitive
behaviour, market manipulation, malpractice or violations of
other related industry laws or regulations.
SASB 510a.1
Rationale
This metric is a critical advanced indicator of ethical behaviour, focusing on the companyâ€™s observed
behaviour and relying on outside parties (regulators) and a robust formal process (enforcement and the
courts) to assess that behaviour. Additionally, measurement in monetary terms facilitates comparison
across firms.
Additional commentary
To assess the ethical standing of a company, it is important to monitor the processes in place to foster
the right culture and behaviours, as well as the extent to which these processes are adhered to over time.
Violations of laws governing corporate behaviour are a useful proxy for assessing this adherence.
