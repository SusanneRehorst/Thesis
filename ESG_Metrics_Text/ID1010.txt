Integrating risk and opportunity into business process
Company risk factor and opportunity disclosures that clearly
identify the principal material risks and opportunities facing the
company specifically (as opposed to generic sector risks), the
company appetite in respect of these risks, how these risks and
opportunities have moved over time and the response to those
changes. These opportunities and risks should integrate material
economic, environmental and social issues, including climate
change and data stewardship.

Rationale
This disclosure focuses on company-specific risks and opportunities, the onus on the board to oversee
management of those risks and opportunities, and the corporate response over time as they change; it
provides broad, management- and board-centred insight.
Additional commentary
A clear understanding and synthesis of corporate appetite, board oversight and management’s enterprise
risk management systems in relation to key emerging risks and opportunities (specifically those related to
economic, environmental and social issues) is fundamental to long-term value creation. This disclosure
was selected on the basis that it acknowledges the requirement for the board to be directly involved with
management in understanding and reacting to material risks and opportunities and the need to observe
how the board and management adapt their positions over time.
This disclosure acknowledges traditional risk management and the need for boards and management to
look beyond risks to the opportunities provided to the business by emerging issues, and specifically those
related to economic, environmental and social issues.
Climate change and data stewardship are critical aspects of this disclosure, as they affect long-term
value for almost all companies, but are typically under-reported. As noted by the World Business Council
for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), “in a time of climate emergency, it’s important for businesses
to…consider the transformational changes and associated transition risks needed to achieve climate
resilience”.36 Data stewardship is also critical for most companies. It includes responsibility for personal
data, as well as the use and governance of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The financial and
reputational impact when companies fail to consider data stewardship can be substantial.37
