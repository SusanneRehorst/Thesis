Rationale
Companies that offer a living wage to workers and employees can help lift households and communities
out of poverty. A living wage provides a benchmark for responsible employers who respect human
rights and who choose to pay their employees a rate that meets the basic cost of living in the region
they operate in. The provision of a living wage could strengthen the organizations’ reputation, reduce
employee turnover and lower the risk of strike action by workers.
