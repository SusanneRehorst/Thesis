GRI 405-1b
Rationale
Empowering and promoting social and economic inclusion, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race,
ethnicity, origin, religion or other status is an important aspect of good people management. Gender
and ethnic/cultural diversity, particularly within executive teams, are closely correlated to both financial
and non-financial performance and enhance the stability of companies across the globe. More diverse
companies are better able to innovate, attract top talent, improve their customer orientation, enhance
employee satisfaction and secure a licence to operate. Inclusion and diversity are likely to become core to
an organizationâ€™s business model in the future. Companies that focus on improving inclusion and diversity
in their workforce can reap both tangible and intangible benefits.
Additional commentary
Ethnicity issues have received renewed focus with recent events across the globe, including the Black
Lives Matter movement. Reporting on these aspects provides an opportunity to identify disparities within
the organization and helps improve the culture across the value chain. The suggested age groups for
reporting on this disclosure are: under 30 years old, 30-50 years old and over 50 years old.
