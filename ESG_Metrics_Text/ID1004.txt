Rationale
The incentives provided to board members and senior executives, and the way they are structured, can
significantly reinforce or impede long-term value creation. Importantly, this disclosure requires the reporting
organization to explicitly address how its approach to remuneration relates to the organization’s economic,
environmental and social objectives.
Additional commentary
If remuneration is incongruent with long-term objectives, including a combination of commercial and
societal value creation, it can undermine the ability of governance bodies to provide effective oversight.
This disclosure is an important advanced indicator of board quality, providing detailed insight into the
various mechanisms for remuneration and how they are applied. Disclosing how incentives for governing
bodies are aligned to long-term value serves as a useful indication of the organization’s ability to achieve
that value. This level of disclosure provides valuable insight for external stakeholders in evaluating the
alignment of different aspects of governance and fosters increased transparency and trust.
