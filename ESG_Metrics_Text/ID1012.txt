Climate change Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
For all relevant greenhouse gases (e.g. carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, F-gases etc.), report in metric tonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) GHG Protocol Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions.
Estimate and report material upstream and downstream (GHG
Protocol Scope 3) emissions where appropriate.

Rationale
GHG emissions are the primary driver of rising global temperatures and therefore a key focus for policy,
regulatory, market and technology responses to limit climate change. As a result, business models
associated with significant emissions are likely to be more impacted by risks in the transition to a lowcarbon economy. While challenges remain in the accurate quantification of Scope 3 emissions, companies
across all major sectors of the economy already report on Scope 3 emissions and, in the context of the
transition to a low-carbon economy, material Scope 3 emissions may have a significant bearing on a
companyâ€™s potential for long-term value creation.
