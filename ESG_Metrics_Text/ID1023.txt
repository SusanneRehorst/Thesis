Water pollution Nutrients
Estimate and report wherever material along the value
chain: metric tonnes of nitrogen, phosphorous and
potassium in fertilizer consumed.
SASB CN0101-
11
Rationale
Keeping nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium cycles in balance is critical to the effective functioning of
ecosystems. Current agricultural practices have pushed bio-available levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium far beyond sustainable thresholds in many parts of the world, leading to freshwater and oceanic
dead zones and a host of other ecological and public health issues. “Biogeochemical flows” (of nitrogen
and phosphorous) is one of only two of the nine planetary boundaries42 that is already deemed to have
been breached. As such, all organizations with significant agricultural operations or supply chains are
recommended to identify their exposure to this global problem.
Additional commentary
In addition to companies with significant agricultural or forestry operations, this metric is likely to be material
to long-term value creation for any companies that rely on a significant volume of inputs from agricultural or
forestry systems. Proactive measures to avoid excess nutrients entering the environment are a key aspect
of good ecological stewardship and should form part of agreements with agricultural or forestry suppliers.
Alongside this disclosure, companies may wish to disclose the year-on-year change in each figure as
well as additional information on measures to avoid excess nutrients entering the wider environment, and
evidence of their effectiveness.
