Rationale
The rapid changes in global markets and business models including technology have led to a rise in skills
gaps. It is imperative for organizations to identify skills gaps and train employees to bridge the gaps. It
is paramount for organizations, society and investors alike to measure the effects of available skills and
learning. A company will be rewarded in the market based on the value it generates for its stakeholders.
Investing in relevant training programmes will help organizations fill vacant skilled positions, thereby
improving productivity and reducing employee turnover.
Additional commentary
1. Report on the number of unfilled skilled positions (a skilled position is unfilled if it is vacant for 90 days).
2. Report on the percentage of unfilled skilled positions for which the company hires unskilled candidates
and trains them.
Organizations can use the regional definition for “skilled” as per the location they operate in.
