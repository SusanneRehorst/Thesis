Water consumption and withdrawal in water-stressed areas
Report for operations where material: megalitres of water
withdrawn, megalitres of water consumed and the percentage
of each in regions with high or extremely high baseline water
stress, according to WRI Aqueduct water risk atlas tool.
Estimate and report the same information for the full value chain
(upstream and downstream) where appropriate.

Rationale
Water consumption and water withdrawal in water-stressed areas are indicators of the potential for
negative societal impacts (resulting from competition with other water users) and associated business
risks including the potential for operational disruptions and shutdowns.
Additional commentary
This metric is only likely to be considered material to long-term value creation by a subset of companies
with significant water consumption and withdrawal in water-stressed areas. Alongside this disclosure, such
companies may wish to disclose the year-on-year change in each figure as well as additional information
on their water stewardship approach.
