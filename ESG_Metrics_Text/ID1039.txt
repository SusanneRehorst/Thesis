Rationale
There is a growing recognition that the well-being of employees has a positive impact on organizational
success as well as on employee health, professional fulfilment and quality of life. Research has consistently
shown that employee well-being predicts job attitudes and performance. It has important implications for
productivity and work relationships. Having a hygienic, safe and healthy workplace culture contributes to a
high-performing organization with employees who are socially integrated.
Additional commentary
1. Report on the following information for all employees and workers who are not employees, but whose
work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization:
– The number of fatalities as a result of work-related ill-health
– The number of cases of recordable work-related ill-health
– The main types of work-related ill-health
2. Disclose information on the percentage of employees participating in “best practice” health and wellbeing programmes. Well-being programmes are categorized under lifestyle management, disease
management and access to healthcare. Report on the absenteeism rate (AR) for all employees.
