Climate change Paris-aligned GHG emissions targets
Define and report progress against time-bound science-based
GHG emissions targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris
Agreement – to limit global warming to well below 2°C above
pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.
This should include defining a date before 2050 by which you
will achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and interim
reduction targets based on the methodologies provided by the
Science Based Targets initiative, if applicable.
If an alternative approach is taken, disclose the methodology
used to calculate the targets and the basis on which they deliver
on the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Rationale
The Paris Agreement on climate change sets a long-term goal to keep the increase in global average
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to
1.5°C, recognizing that this would substantially reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. All actors,
including businesses, need to play their part in delivering on this goal if we are to avoid the worst effects of
climate change. In June 2020, countries representing more than half of global GDP set or committed to set
net-zero-by-2050 targets and more than 900 companies have published science-based targets consistent
with the Paris Agreement. As such, defining emissions targets that are at least consistent with meeting the
goal of the Paris Agreement is fast becoming the minimum expectation for businesses.
