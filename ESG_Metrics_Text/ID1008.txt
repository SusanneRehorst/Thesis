Ethical behaviour Alignment of strategy and policies to lobbying
The significant issues that are the focus of the company’s
participation in public policy development and lobbying; the
company’s strategy relevant to these areas of focus; and any
differences between its lobbying positions and its purpose,
stated policies, goals or other public positions.
GRI 415: Public
Policy 2016
Rationale
Consistency between corporate activity related to lobbying and the firm’s publicly stated purpose and
strategy is a core component of alignment on long-term objectives, which in turn is essential for longterm value creation. Monitoring this consistency is an important element of overall transparency and the
authentic pursuit of the company’s objectives.
Additional commentary
To create long-term value, corporate behaviour needs to conform to existing norms but also to align with the
corporation’s long-term objectives, both commercial and societal. This disclosure is a critical advanced indicator
of corporate behaviour, by providing insight into the extent to which lobbying and advocacy (an important
but potentially damaging area of corporate activity for stakeholders) is not only permissible but aligned to the
company’s publicly stated objectives and purpose. Reporting organizations will need to be mindful of local laws,
which can shape or constrain the way the standard cited here as a guideline is implemented.
