Nature loss Land use and ecological sensitivity
Report the number and area (in hectares) of sites owned,
leased or managed in or adjacent to protected areas and/or key
biodiversity areas (KBA).
GRI 304-1
Rationale
KBAs provide a science-based and internationally recognized means of identifying sites contributing
significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, while protected areas indicate nationally (and
often internationally) recognized areas of ecological or cultural importance, typically with specific legal
protections. Having operations inside or close to such areas indicates heightened risk of adverse impacts
on biodiversity and heightened risk of exposure to associated legal or reputational risk.
Additional commentary
This metric will only be applicable to a subset of companies with operations in or adjacent to protected
areas or KBAs, but for these companies it is an important indicator of heightened risk of adverse impacts
on biodiversity and heightened risk of exposure to associated legal or reputational risk. Alongside this
disclosure, companies may wish to share information on the measures in place to ensure effective
stewardship of these sites.
