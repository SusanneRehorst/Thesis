Rationale
A responsible business respects the human rights of its workers, including their right to exercise freedom of
association and collective bargaining. It is important to have a proper governance structure in place which
embraces these human rights and makes it possible to promote and realize decent conditions at work. Freedom
of association and collective bargaining are the basis for all human rights in the workplace (e.g. living wage,
decent work conditions, equal opportunities). Organizations that support these rights internally and externally
across the value chain can better mitigate the risk of potential conflicts as well as safeguard business continuity.
Additional commentary
1. Report on the percentage of the active workforce covered under collective bargaining agreements. The
active workforce is defined as the maximum number of unique employees employed at any time during
the fiscal year. The scope includes all personnel employed by the registrant, including full-time, part-time
and temporary employees.
2. Workersâ€™ rights to exercise freedom of association or collective bargaining may be violated or at
significant risk either in terms of type of operations and countries or geographic areas. Disclose the
information related and provide the remediation measures taken in the reporting period to support and
protect the rights of collective bargaining across the value chain.
